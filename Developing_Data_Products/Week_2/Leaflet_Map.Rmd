## Guidelines

Craft a web page utilizing R Markdown showcasing a Leaflet-generated map.

Publish your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Ensure your webpage displays the document's creation date and includes an interactive Leaflet map.

Feel free to express your creativity!

## Evaluation Criteria

Does the webpage display a creation date, and is this date within two months of the grading date for this assignment?

Does the webpage showcase an interactive map evidently created using Leaflet?


## Overview

The assignment involved creating an interactive map using the `leaflet` package in R to display the capitals of Indian states and union territories. The code began by loading the necessary library and defining a data frame containing information about the states, their capitals, and corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates. Then, a Leaflet map was generated with a default tile layer added for the map background. Markers were placed to indicate the capital cities, with popups displaying both the state name and the capital name enclosed in brackets. Overall, the assignment demonstrated how to create an interactive map visualization in R effectively showcasing geographic data.

## Generating Leaflet Maps
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

The line `library(leaflet)` loads the leaflet package, which offers functions for creating interactive maps.


```{r}
indian_states <- data.frame(
  state = c("Andaman and Nicobar Islands", "Andhra Pradesh", "Arunachal Pradesh", "Assam", "Bihar", 
            "Chandigarh", "Chhattisgarh", "Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu", "Delhi", 
            "Goa", "Gujarat", "Haryana", "Himachal Pradesh", "Jammu and Kashmir", "Jharkhand",

              "Kolkata"),

          31.1471, 26.9124, 27.3389, 13.0827, 17.3850, 23.8315, 26.8467, 30.3165, 22.5726),
  lng = c(92.7265, 80.6480, 93.6237, 91.7898, 85.1376, 76.7794, 81.6296, 72.8328, 77.2090, 
          73.8278, 72.6369, 76.0856, 77.1734, 74.7973, 85.3096, 77.5946, 76.9366, 77.5770,

)
```
The above block of code defines a data frame named indian_states, which contains information about Indian states, their capitals, and their latitude and longitude coordinates. Each column of the data frame corresponds to:

state: Name of the Indian state or union territory.

capital: Capital city of the respective state or union territory.

lat: Latitude coordinate of the capital city.

lng: Longitude coordinate of the capital city.





```{r}

my_map <- leaflet(indian_states) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(~lng, ~lat, popup = paste(indian_states$state, " (", indian_states$capital, ")"))

```

* `my_map <- leaflet(indian_states) %>%`: Initializes a Leaflet map object named `my_map` using the `leaflet()` function and `indian_states` data frame.

* `addTiles() %>%`: Adds a default tile layer (map background) to the Leaflet map.

* `addMarkers(~lng, ~lat, popup = paste(indian_states$state, " (", indian_states$capital, ")"))`: Adds markers to the map at specified coordinates, with popups displaying concatenated state and capital names from `indian_states`.



## Display the map

##### The below line `my_map` simply displays the my_map object, showing the generated Leaflet map with markers and popups.

```{r}
# Display the map
my_map
```
