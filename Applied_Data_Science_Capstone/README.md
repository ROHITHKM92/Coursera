# 🚀 IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX 🌌

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the IBM Data Science Capstone Project on SpaceX! In this exciting journey, we will dive into predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers charging up to $165 million, thanks to the reusability of the first stage. If we can predict the landing success, we can estimate launch costs, providing valuable insights for companies competing with SpaceX. 

This capstone simulates the real-life data science process, giving you the experience of working with real datasets. You'll step into the shoes of a Data Scientist at a startup aiming to rival SpaceX, following the Data Science methodology through various stages:

Your mission is to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

## 🚀 Business Problem

SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, compared to other providers charging up to $165 million, largely due to the reusability of the first stage. By accurately predicting the first stage landing success, you can estimate the launch cost. Your Data Science insights and models will help the startup you work for make informed bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## 🎯 Objective

- Apply data science tools and machine learning to predict the first stage rocket landing success, determining the launch cost.
- Gain deeper insights from the data through exploration.

## 📊 Business Metric

### Confusion Matrix Labels
- **True Positive (TP)**: The model correctly predicts the first stage will land successfully.
- **True Negative (TN)**: The model correctly predicts the first stage will not land successfully.
- **False Positive (FP)** (Type I Error): The model predicts the first stage will land successfully, but it does not.
- **False Negative (FN)** (Type II Error): The model predicts the first stage will not land successfully, but it does.

### Performance Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
   <br>
   $$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + TN + FN}$$

2. **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results in the predicted positives.
   <br>
   $$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$

3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of true positive results in the actual positives.
   <br>
   $$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$

4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   <br>
   $$\text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$

5. **Specificity**: The proportion of true negative results in the actual negatives.
   <br>
   $$\text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}$$
